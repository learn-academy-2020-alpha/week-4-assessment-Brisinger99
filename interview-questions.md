# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer:

  An instance variable is only referenced inside of a class

  Researched answer:

  An instance variable is a variable that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class

2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  A block is either a function or hash

  Researched answer:

  A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:

  You don't need a return for the end of a function

  Researched answer:

  when return isn't explicitly called within a method then Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method.

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  object-oriented programming is baised on using classes and hashes

  Researched answer:

  Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:

  An object only contains information while a class has both information and methods.

  Researched answer:

  A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class
